 UCCD2513 T14 Week 5 Activity

1. Convert the code chunk found under section Divide an image into smaller patches using cropping into a function with the following signature:
 ```
 crop_grid(img, num_horizontal_grid, num_vertical_grid, line_color)
 # img is the source image
 # num_horizontal_grid and num_vertical_grid are the number of patches along x and y axes.
 # line_color is the color of the grid line.
 # The output of the function should be image with grids
 ```

2. Display image sequences of smooth transition of two images with different values of Î±. Refer to code in section "Image blending". Use "lena.jfif" and "coins.jfif" as the base images.

3. Rotate image by 45 degrees without cropping the sides of the image. (Hint: There are 2 strategies to tackle these problems). Use "lena.jfif" as the input image.
 - Use external libraries imutils.
 - Modify the transformation matrix.

4. Use the images with titles: "flower.jfif" and "native-bee.png". I want to put flower above an image. If I add two images, it will change color. If I blend it, I get a transparent effect. But I want it to be opaque. If it was a rectangular region, we could use the ROI as we did in the previous section. But flower is not a rectangular region. This is where bitwise operations, like AND, OR, NOT and XOR really come in handy. The associated functions are `cv.bitwise_and()`, `cv.bitwise_or()` and `cv.bitwise_not()`. You need to use `cv.threshold` function to segment the flower. Please refer to ![online documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d2/de8/group__core__array.html#ga60b4d04b251ba5eb1392c34425497e14) for more info. The result should resemble the following:
